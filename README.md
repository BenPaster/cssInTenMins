#inTenMins

This is a bunch of tutorials that will teach you the gist of a web topic in less than ten minutes. 

All tutorials are extremely TL;DR friendly. If you'd like to understand _whyyyy_ things work, you have most definitely come to the wrong place. If you would like a crash course in how some things work, you have come to the right place. 

**Please contribute! Just make sure to keep the same TL;DR style.**
